        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Yummy gluten-free and wheat-free breads, specially popular in the Brazilian</p>
        <p>state of Minas Gerais.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil or butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup milk or soy milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups tapioca flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees C (375 degrees F).</li>
            <li>Mix oil, water, milk and salt in a large saucepan and place over high heat.
                Bring to a boil and immediately remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in tapioca flour and garlic, stirring until smooth. Let it rest for 10
                to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir cheese and eggs into tapioca mixture until combined; the dough will be
                chunky, like cottage cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Drop dough by 1/4 cup size balls onto a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned, 15 to 20
                minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
